Open up to 2 CSPs per day with strikes 10\u201320% OTM and premium \u2265 $0.10, respecting collateral caps. Place all trades as LIMIT orders, one nickel concession max. Immediately stage GTC buybacks at 50% of credit, then 25% after first fill. Manage assignments with covered calls, same rules. If cash is too small for options, run a 3-level share ladder buy/sell with fractional shares. Always obey PDT, liquidity guards, and never exceed collateral rules. Log everything.",
