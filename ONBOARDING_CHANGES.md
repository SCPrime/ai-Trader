# Onboarding Changes - Complete Implementation

## 🎯 KEY CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ NO Personal Information Collection
**Removed from AI-Guided Setup**:
- ❌ Name field (removed)
- ❌ Email field (removed)
- ❌ Test group selection (removed)

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// UserSetupAI.tsx:95
const user = createUser(
  undefined, // No name
  undefined, // No email
  undefined, // No test group
  { ...preferences } // Only trading preferences
);
```

### 2. ✅ Comprehensive AI Preferences Verification

**Review Screen Shows ALL Extracted Fields**:
- 💰 Investment Amount (with mode: range/custom/unlimited)
- 🛡️ Risk Tolerance (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- 📈 Trading Style (day trading/swing/momentum/etc)
- 🎯 Instruments (stocks/ETFs/options/bonds/crypto)
- 👀 Watchlist (specific symbols user mentioned)

**User Can**:
- Review all AI-extracted assumptions
- Click "Make Changes" to go back and re-chat
- Click "Complete Setup" to confirm and save

**AI Conversation Flow**:
1. User describes goals in natural language
2. AI extracts ALL preferences from the message
3. Shows comprehensive verification screen
4. User verifies or edits
5. Saves ONLY preferences (no personal data)

### 3. ✅ All Mock Data Cleared

**Components Updated to Use ONLY Real Data**:

#### AIRecommendations.tsx
- **Before**: Fell back to mock recommendations
- **After**: Shows error if backend unavailable
- **Why**: Ensures accuracy - user knows if data is stale

#### Analytics.tsx
- **Before**: "Generate sample data"
- **After**: "Fetch real account data from Alpaca"
- **Note**: Historical trends still calculated (Alpaca doesn't provide history)

#### Active Positions
- **Always Real**: Shows actual AAPL and SPY positions
- **No Fallback**: Empty state if no positions

#### Market Data (Center Logo)
- **Live SPY/QQQ**: Updates every 30s from Alpaca quotes
- **No Mock**: Falls back to last fetched if API fails

### 4. ✅ localStorage Persistence Restored

**Before**:
```typescript
// Cleared on every page load
localStorage.clear();
```

**After**:
```typescript
// Only checks if user exists
const userExists = isUserLoggedIn();
```

**Result**:
- First visit: Shows onboarding
- Return visits: Remembers preferences
- Can manually clear and re-onboard anytime

### 5. ✅ User Preferences Drive All Views

**Where Preferences Are Applied**:

1. **Strategy Builder**:
   - Position sizing based on investment amount
   - Risk params based on risk tolerance
   - Default instruments based on preferences

2. **Morning Routine**:
   - Watchlist alerts for user's symbols
   - Risk checks based on tolerance settings

3. **Research Dashboard**:
   - Filters by preferred instruments
   - Sorts by watchlist priority

4. **AI Recommendations**:
   - Tailored to risk tolerance
   - Matches trading style
   - Focuses on preferred instruments

5. **P&L Dashboard**:
   - Baseline from investment amount
   - Risk metrics based on tolerance
