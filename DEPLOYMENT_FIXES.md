# Critical Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ❌ Missing Proxy API Route
**Problem**: `frontend/pages/api/proxy/[...path].ts` didn't exist. The 500 error on `/api/proxy/api/health` was because there was no proxy route.

**Fix**: Created `frontend/pages/api/proxy/[...path].ts` with:
- Server-side token hiding (never exposed to browser)
- Path allowlisting (only `/api/health`, `/api/settings`, `/api/positions`, `/api/trading/execute`)
- Rate limiting (60 req/min per IP, in-memory)
- Request forwarding with proper headers
- Cache control headers (`no-store`)
- Rate limit response headers with reset timestamp

### 2. ❌ Token Auto-Generation Mismatch
**Problem**: `render.yaml` had `generateValue: true` for `API_TOKEN`, which would create a token Vercel wouldn't know about.

**Fix**: Changed to `sync: false`, which means you **must manually set** the same `API_TOKEN` value in both:
- Render dashboard → Environment
- Vercel dashboard → Environment Variables (Server-only)

**Action Required**: Generate one secure token and set it in both places:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 3. ❌ Localhost Redis URL
**Problem**: `REDIS_URL: redis://localhost:6379` won't work on Render.

**Fix**: Changed to `sync: false`. You **must set** a real Redis URL in Render dashboard.

**Options**:
- Render Key-Value (managed Redis): https://render.com/docs/redis
- Upstash Redis: https://upstash.com/
- Redis Cloud: https://redis.com/try-free/

**Action Required**: Create Redis instance and set `REDIS_URL` in Render dashboard.

### 4. ⚠️ Missing Security Headers
**Problem**: `next.config.js` had no security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

**Fix**: Added comprehensive security headers to `next.config.js`:
- `Content-Security-Policy` with strict directives
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### 5. ⚠️ Region Alignment
**Problem**: `vercel.json` had `regions: ["iad1"]` (Virginia) but `render.yaml` had no region specified.

**Fix**: Set `region: virginia` in `render.yaml` to minimize latency (both in Virginia now).

### 6. ⚠️ Deprecated Config Field
**Problem**: `render.yaml` used `env: python` (older syntax).

**Fix**: Changed to `runtime: python` (current best practice).

## Files Modified

```
M  backend/render.yaml           ← Fixed token/Redis config, region, runtime
A  frontend/pages/api/proxy/[...path].ts  ← CREATED proxy route
M  frontend/next.config.js       ← Added security headers
M  frontend/vercel.json          ← Already had security headers (kept)
```

## Manual Steps Required Before Deploy

### Step 1: Generate API Token
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```
Copy this value. You'll use it in both Render and Vercel.

### Step 2: Set Up Redis

**Option A: Render Key-Value (Easiest)**
1. Render Dashboard → New → Redis
2. Name: `ai-trader-redis`
3. Region: `Virginia (US East)`
4. Plan: Free (0.1 GB)
5. Copy the **Internal Redis URL** (starts with `redis://`)

**Option B: Upstash (Free Tier)**
1. https://upstash.com/ → Create Database
2. Copy the Redis URL

### Step 3: Configure Render Environment
In Render dashboard for `ai-trader-backend`:
- `API_TOKEN` = (the token from Step 1)
- `REDIS_URL` = (the Redis URL from Step 2)
- `ALLOW_ORIGIN` = `https://ai-trader-snowy.vercel.app`
- `LIVE_TRADING` = `false`

### Step 4: Configure Vercel Environment
In Vercel dashboard for the project, **Server-side variables only**:
- `BACKEND_API_BASE_URL` = (your Render URL, e.g., `https://ai-trader-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`)
- `API_TOKEN` = (the **same** token from Step 1)

### Step 5: Deploy
1. **Render**:
   - Branch: `feat/option-a-cloud-backend`
   - Root: `backend/`

2. **Vercel**:
   - Branch: `feat/option-a-cloud-backend`
   - Root: `frontend/`

## Verification

After deployment, test:

```bash
# Health check (should return JSON, not 500)
curl -s https://ai-trader-snowy.vercel.app/api/proxy/api/health | jq .

# Should show: {"status":"healthy","redis":"connected",...}
```

If Redis shows `"redis":"disconnected"`, check your `REDIS_URL` in Render dashboard.

## What's Now Working

✅ Proxy route exists and will forward requests
✅ Security headers in place (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
✅ Rate limiting with proper headers including reset time
✅ No-store cache control to prevent edge caching
✅ Token sync requirements documented
✅ Redis URL must be real (not localhost)
✅ Region alignment (both Virginia)
✅ Modern Render config syntax

## Files Ready to Commit

All critical fixes are staged and ready. The proxy will work once you:
1. Set matching `API_TOKEN` in both Render and Vercel
2. Set real `REDIS_URL` in Render
3. Point Vercel to `frontend/` on `feat/option-a-cloud-backend` branch
